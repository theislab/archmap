Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of the Helmholtz Zentrum München. The use of the Internet pages of the Helmholtz Zentrum München is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special platform services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.</p>\n              \n              <p>The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the Helmholtz Zentrum München. By means of this data protection declaration, our platform would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.</p>\n              \n              <p>As the controller, the Helmholtz Zentrum München has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone. </p>\n              \n              <h4>1. Definitions</h4>\n              <p>The data protection declaration of the Helmholtz Zentrum München is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.</p>\n              \n              <p>In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:</p>\n              \n              <ul>\n              <li><h4>a)    Personal data</h4>\n              <p>Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>\n              </li>\n              <li><h4>b) Data subject</h4>\n              <p>Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible for the processing.</p>\n              </li>\n              <li><h4>c)    Processing</h4>\n              <p>Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction. </p>\n              </li>\n              <li><h4>d)    Restriction of processing</h4>\n              <p>Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future. </p>\n              </li>\n              <li><h4>e)    Profiling</h4>\n              <p>Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements. </p>\n              </li>\n              <li><h4>f)     Pseudonymisation</h4>\n              <p>Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person. </p>\n              </li>\n              <li><h4>g)    Controller or controller responsible for the processing</h4>\n              <p>Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law. </p>\n              </li>\n              <li><h4>h)    Processor</h4>\n              <p>Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller. </p>\n              </li>\n              <li><h4>i)      Recipient</h4>\n              <p>Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing. </p>\n              </li>\n              <li><h4>j)      Third party</h4>\n              <p>Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.</p>\n              </li>\n              <li><h4>k)    Consent</h4>\n              <p>Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her. </p>\n              </li>\n              </ul>\n              \n              <h4>2.

Name and Address of the Data Protection Officer</h4>\n              <p>The Data Protection Officer of the controller is:</p>\n              Werner Bergheim\n              <p>Helmholtz Zentrum München</p>\n              <p>Ingolstädter Landstraße 1</p>\n              <p>85764 Neuherberg</p>\n              <p>Deutschland</p>\n              <p>Email: datenschutz@helmholtz-muenchen.de</p>\n              \n              <p>Any data subject may, at any time, contact our Data Protection Officer directly with all questions and suggestions concerning data protection.</p>\n              \n              <h4>4. Collection of general data and information</h4>\n              <p>The website of the Helmholtz Zentrum München collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.</p>\n              \n              <p>When using these general data and information, the Helmholtz Zentrum München does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the Helmholtz Zentrum München analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our platform, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.</p>\n              \n              <h4>5. Registration on our website</h4>\n              <p>The data subject has the possibility to register on the website of the controller with the indication of personal data. Which personal data are transmitted to the controller is determined by the respective input mask used for the registration. The personal data entered by the data subject are collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller, and for his own purposes. The controller may request transfer to one or more processors (e.g. a parcel service) that also uses personal data for an internal purpose which is attributable to the controller.</p>\n              \n              <p>By registering on the website of the controller, the IP address—assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject—date, and time of the registration are also stored. The storage of this data takes place against the background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses. Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the controller. This data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.\n              \n              </p>\n              \n              <p>The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary indication of personal data, is intended to enable the controller to offer the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users due to the nature of the matter in question. Registered persons are free to change the personal data specified during the registration at any time, or to have them completely deleted from the data stock of the controller.</p>\n              \n              <p>The data controller shall, at any time, provide information upon request to each data subject as to what personal data are stored about the data subject. In addition, the data controller shall correct or erase personal data at the request or indication of the data subject, insofar as there are no statutory storage obligations. The entirety of the controller’s employees are available to the data subject in this respect as contact persons.</p>\n              \n              <h4>6. Contact possibility via the website </h4>\n              <p>This platform contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to our platform, as well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). All contact forms are sent to the employees at Helmholtz Zentrum München responsible for the platform.\n              If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored. Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject. There is no transfer of this personal data to third parties.</p>\n              \n              <h4>7. Processing of user files with ScArches</h4>\n              <p>\n              1. Scope of the processing of uploaded files<br/><br/>\n              Our platform offers a user the ability to process their uploaded files using the package ScArches. As a rule, our users' personal data are processed only with the consent of the user. An exception applies in those cases in which it is not possible to obtain prior consent due to factual reasons and statutory provisions permit the processing of the data.</p>\n              \n              <p>\n              2. Legal basis of the data processing<br/><br/>\n              If the user has consented, the legal basis for the processing of the uploaded user data is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n              3. Purpose of The data processing<br/><br/>\n              The purpose of the data processing is in order to output the ScArches result based on the user's inputted data.\n              </p>\n              4.

This applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If the data subject objects to the Helmholtz Zentrum München to the processing for direct marketing purposes, the Helmholtz Zentrum München will no longer process the personal data for these purposes.</p>\n              \n              <p>In addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her by the Helmholtz Zentrum München for scientific or historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.</p>\n              \n              <p>In order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may contact any employee of the Helmholtz Zentrum München. In addition, the data subject is free in the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications.</p>\n              </li>\n              <li><h4>h) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling</h4>\n              <p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as the decision (1) is not is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the data subject's explicit consent.</p>\n              \n              <p>If the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) it is based on the data subject's explicit consent, the Helmholtz Zentrum München shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and contest the decision.</p>\n              \n              <p>If the data subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated individual decision-making, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the Helmholtz Zentrum München.</p>\n              \n              </li>\n              <li><h4>i) Right to withdraw data protection consent </h4>\n              <p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to withdraw his or her consent to processing of his or her personal data at any time. </p>\n              \n              <p>If the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the consent, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the Helmholtz Zentrum München.</p>\n              \n              </li>\n              </ul>\n              <h4>10. Legal basis for the processing </h4>\n              <p>Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR.\n              In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR.\n              Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).\n              </p>\n              \n              <h4>11. Disclosure of information for certain purposes to to third-parties</h4>\n              <p>The website uses third-party services such as Google Cloud. The information that we potentially disclose to third parties is as described below:\n              <br/>\n              <br/>\n              • Information on the browser type and the version in use\n              <br/>\n              • The user's operating system\n              <br/>\n              • The user's internet service provider\n              <br/>\n              • The user's pseudonymized IP address\n              <br/>\n              • Date and time of day of the access\n              <br/>\n              • Websites from which the user's system reaches our website\n              <br/>\n              • Websites that the user's system accesses through our website     \n              <br/> \n              <h4>12. Period for which the personal data will be stored</h4>\n              <p>The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period [PLACEHOLDER].</p>\n              \n              <h4>13. Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data </h4>\n              <p>We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner).\n              \n              Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded.\n              \n              Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.\n              </p>\n              \n              <h4>14. Existence of automated decision-making</h4>\n              <p>As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.</p>\n              \n              <p>Developed by the specialists for <a href=\"https://willing-able.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LegalTech</a> at Willing & Able that also developed the system for <a href=\"https://abletotrain.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">data protection officer training</a>.

## ArchMap
ArchMap is an open-source web platform that enables anybody to use [scArches](https://github.com/theislab/scarches), a package that enables reference-based analysis of single-cell data. With this innovative approach, researchers can easily analyze their own datasets in an automated way by choosing a reference of their choice. ArchMap offers multiple references for analysis. The list of available references is always expanding, with new additions every month. 
Currently, ArchMap only provides mapping capabilities, but this will be expanded in the future. 


ArchMap is currently hosted at: www.genecruncher.com (domain to be replaced soon). Feel free to check it out.

## Background and Main Features
ArchMap is meant to enable scientists to easily use innovative advances in single-cell mapping. 
ArchMap provides many useful features for users. Using using [scArches](https://github.com/theislab/scarches), the core functionality is the mapping of query user datasets to reference atlases. Multiple reference atlases are provided and can be explored on the platform.

In addition to the mapping functionality, another key feature is collaboration. Users can collaborate together in teams and share their visualizations in an instant and secure way, without reuploading and remapping. 

Users have two options to upload their datasets. A user can either log in, upload and have their results stored on the cloud for future use, or map without logging in. Without logging in, a user's results will only be stored in the cache for future use.

## Install
This repository includes both the frontend, backend, and machine learning pipeline code. 
To install any of these parts locally, please follow the steps in the READMEs of each of the respective sections.

## Usage
ArchMap is currently being deployed live at: www.archmap.bio. See [here](https://genecruncher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for platform documentation. A brief, 30 second guide is also included on the [landing page](www.genecruncher.com).
